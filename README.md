Serious Business
----------------

I've seen a lot of cool dashboard ideas lately, and I thought I'd try and write something fun that displayed business analytics in a dashboard-y way.  It'd be cool if this could be done in some really generic way but I don't know how well that will work out.

Thanks you very much to [Simon Engledew](http://www.github.com/simon-engledew)
who designed the main dashboard and tidied up my JS an awful lot.

Installing etc
==============

* Clone the repo
* Install [redis](http://redis.io)
* Get your ruby environment set up - I use [RVM](http://rvm.io)
* Run the app from the command line or set it up to run through passenger.
* Cron your sensors to run as often as you'd like.

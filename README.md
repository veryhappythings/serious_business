Serious Business
----------------

I've seen a lot of cool dashboard ideas lately, and I thought I'd try and write something fun that displayed business analytics in a dashboard-y way.  It'd be cool if this could be done in some really generic way but I don't know how well that will work out.

Thanks you very much to [Simon Engledew](http://www.github.com/simon-engledew)
who designed the main dashboard and tidied up my JS an awful lot.
